        <h1>General description</h1><br>
        <p>Donating blood is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. 
            There are several types of blood donation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Each type helps meet different medical needs.</p><br>
        </div>

            <h1>Blood donation</h1><br>
        
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components: red blood cells, plasma, and sometimes platelets.</p><br>
        
    </div>
    <div class = ''>    
    <h1>Aferesis</h1><br>
        
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>During apheresis, you will be connected to a machine that collects and separates different elements from the blood. These blood components include red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The machine then returns the remaining elements of the blood.</p><br>
    
    <br>
    <li>Platelet donation (thrombocytapheresis) collects only platelets. Platelets are cells that help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs (coagulation) in blood vessels.</li><br>
    <br>
    <li>Donated platelets are typically received by people with clotting problems or cancer and by people undergoing an organ transplant or major surgery.</li><br> 
    <br>
    <li>Double red blood cell donation allows you to donate a concentrated amount of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to organs and tissues.</li><br> 
    <br>
    <li>Donated red blood cells are usually given to people with severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and to people with anemia (low hemoglobin).</li><br> 
    <br>
    <li>Plasma donation (plasmapheresis) collects the liquid part of blood (plasma). Plasma allows blood to clot and contains antibodies that help fight infections.</li><br> 
    <br>
    <li>Plasma is commonly given to people in emergency and trauma situations to help stop bleeding.</p><br>  
    </div>

        <br>
        <h1>Why is it done</h1><br>
        <br>
        <p>You agree to have your blood drawn so that it can be given to a person who needs a blood transfusion.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Every year millions of people need blood transfusions. Some people may need blood during surgery. Others depend on it after suffering an accident or because they suffer from a disease that requires certain parts of the blood. Blood donations make all of this possible. There is no substitute for human blood: all transfusions use blood from a donor.</p><br>

        <br>
        <h1>Risks</h1><br>
        <br>
        <p>Donating blood is safe. New, sterile, disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there is no risk of having a blood-borne infection when donating blood.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Most healthy adults can donate a pint (about half a liter) safely, without health risks. Within a few days of a blood donation, the body replaces lost fluids. And after two weeks, it replenishes lost red blood cells.</p><br>

        <br>
        <p>Before donating blood:</p><br>
        <br>
        <li>Get enough sleep the night before donating.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Eat healthy foods before donating. Avoid fatty foods like a hamburger, fries or ice cream.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Drink plenty of water before donating.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Check to see if any medications you are taking or have recently taken prevent you from donating. For example, if you are a platelet donor, you should not take aspirin two days before the donation. Talk to a member of your healthcare team before stopping any medication to donate blood.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Wear a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up.</li><br>

        <br>
        <h2>Before the procedure</h2><br>
        <br>
        <p>Before you can donate blood, you will be asked to complete your medical history confidentially. This includes questions about behaviors that are known to pose an increased risk of blood infections, that is, infections that are transmitted through blood.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Due to the risk of blood-borne infections, not everyone can donate blood. Below are some groups that are not eligible to donate blood:</p><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who has injected illicit drugs, steroids, or another substance not prescribed by a health care provider in the last three months;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>men who have had sexual contact with other men in the last three months;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who has a congenital clotting factor deficiency;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who has tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who has had sex in exchange for money or illicit drugs in the last three months;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who, in the last 12 months, has had close contact (cohabitation or sexual contact) with a person with viral hepatitis;</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>anyone who has had babesiosis, a rare and serious disease transmitted by ticks, or the parasitic infection of Chagas disease.</li><br>
        <br>
        <p>También te realizarán un breve examen físico. Este examen incluye medirte la presión arterial, el pulso y la temperatura corporal. Se toma una pequeña muestra de sangre con un pinchazo en el dedo que se utiliza para controlar el nivel de hemoglobina (la parte que transporta el oxígeno en la sangre). Si la concentración de hemoglobina se encuentra dentro de un rango saludable y cumples con todos los otros requisitos de detección de enfermedades, puedes donar sangre.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class = ''>
        <br>
        <h1>COVID-19</h1><br>
        <br>
        <p>The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been shown to be transmitted through blood transfusions. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggests waiting to donate blood at least 10 days after a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test without symptoms or at least 10 days after COVID-19 symptoms have subsided. completely disappeared.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Those who tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, but did not undergo a diagnostic test and never developed symptoms, can donate without a waiting period or taking a diagnostic test before donating.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Si recibes una vacuna contra la COVID-19 no replicante, inactivada o basada en ARN mensajero, las únicas formas de la vacuna aprobadas actualmente en Estados Unidos, sí puedes donar sangre sin periodo de espera.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class = ''>
        <br>
        <h1>During the procedure</h1><br>
        <br>
        <p>You lie back or sit in a reclining chair with your arm extended over an armrest. If you have a preference on which arm or vein to use, let the person drawing your blood know. A blood pressure cuff or tourniquet is placed around your arm to fill your veins with blood. This makes it easier to identify veins to insert the needle. In addition, it helps the blood bag fill faster. The skin on the inside of the elbow is then cleaned.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>A new sterile needle is placed in a vein in your arm. The needle is attached to a thin plastic tube and a blood bag. Once the needle is in place, you clench your fist several times to increase blood flow through the vein. First, blood is collected into tubes for diagnostic testing. The bag is then allowed to fill with blood, approximately a pint (about half a liter). The needle remains in place for about 10 minutes. When your donation is complete, the needle is removed, a small dressing is placed over the needle site, and a bandage is wrapped around your arm.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Another increasingly common blood donation method is apheresis. During apheresis, you are connected to a machine that can remove and separate different parts of blood, such as red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. This process allows a greater quantity of a certain component to be collected. It takes longer than a standard blood donation, typically up to two hours.</p><br>

        <p>Después de donar sangre debes sentarte en una zona de observación, donde descansas y comes un refrigerio ligero. A los 15 minutos ya podrás irte. Después de la donación de sangre:</p><br>
        <br>
        <li>Drink more fluids.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or lifting heavy loads for about five hours.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>If you feel lightheaded, lie down with your feet elevated until the feeling passes.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>Keep the bandage on and dry for the next five hours.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>If you experience bleeding after removing the bandage, apply pressure to the site and raise your arm until the bleeding stops.</li><br>
        <br>
        <li>If bruising appears, apply a cold compress to the area occasionally for the first 24 hours.</li><br>
