<br> <h1 class="texte">Basic Eligibility Requirements for Blood Donation</h1>
	<p class="text">You may be wondering if you can donate blood. Donating blood is safe and easy to do, but there are a few basic requirements to donate blood. If you're in good health and meet the general eligibility blood donation requirements, then you are likely able to give blood.</p>
	<p class="text">Blood donors are needed every day to save lives. Recent changes by the FDA to eligibility guidance, including the Individual Donor Assessment  and European travel, may mean those once deferred can give. Please review the additional eligibility information below if you have questions about health conditions, HIV risk, medications, travel and more. If you don’t meet the blood donation requirements today or receive a deferral, we encourage you to come back and try again. You will likely be eligible to donate blood in the future.</p>

			<h1>Be in good general health</h1>
			<p>Donors must be in good general health at the time of donation. This means that individuals with colds, flu, sore throats, cold sores, stomach bugs, or any other infections are advised not to donate blood. Additionally, individuals who have recently given birth or had a miscarriage or abortion may have a waiting period before they can donate blood.</p>

<br> <h1 class="textu"> Why are there requirements to donate blood?</h1>
<br> <p class="texta">Eligibility requirements are important to help ensure the safety of both the blood donor and blood recipient. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established blood donation requirements to keep the blood supply safe from bloodborne diseases and also keep patients safe from anything in a donor’s blood (such as a medication) that could harm them. These blood donation requirements also protect donors by making sure they are physically able to safely donate.</p>

									<br>Do not come to donate if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or are subject to quarantine after close contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 infection. If you’ve had COVID-19 more than 10 days ago and your symptoms are resolving, you are eligible to donate.</br>
									<br>Please do NOT donate or enter a Vitalant facility if you are not feeling well. Blood donors are NOT tested for active coronavirus infection.</br>
